## Discord.JS BOT
- This is a 24/7 bot that I made for my [**SCU Discord Network**](https://invite.gg/gobroncos) to provide a comprehensive and effective social media platform for Santa Clara University students to utilize especially in the midst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

  - Utilized the Node.js environment and Node module Discord.js to deploy a bot that greets/sends direct messages, interacts with over 500 students, and performs an assortment of automated tasks to better the server experience. 

  - Programmed Express.js servers to run a **(1)** *server (guild) verification system* which automatically gives graduating year, college major, and verified roles to SCU students and **(2)** *class cooperation system* that places students into text/voice channels aligned with their current General Education classes to talk with peers. Both of these processes grant different server roles based on form responses. 

  - Logged user suggestions to better the server's general UI/UX. 

  - Open to promote this student-run online network if possible by institutional measures.
